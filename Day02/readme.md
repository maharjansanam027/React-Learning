Day 2

when ReactRoot will render some element or anything then inside root whatever will be there it will
cleared and render what it has told to do it.


like this code rediability is gone we can't understand. 

so if we write code in index.html file like in js then it will easy to understand

<h1>
    like this.
</h1>

it will possible not by react. it has additional features jsx which will convert that html type file to react how we are writing write now.

<!-- we cant push this code on production because there is script file react and reactDOM  which has 5k lines of code 
    many code will there our production will slow there is space comments those fucntions which are not in use. so that makes the websiter run slow.

    less file size : fast run
    file size : kam rakna

 -->
 so for this problem 

 we have bundler

it will remove all the extra spaces, comments and what code is in use that only make bundle and it will give us. it will give optimise code.

Bundler name we have
(WebPack, vite, parcel)

React is not doing optimise code. bundler is doing optimise code

parcel we are using

what is npm 
npm stands for node package manager but its not a full form npm means npm

npm is simply we can say it is a database for library of js related works where everyone has contribuute their code to not to rewrite the code.. 

npm is open source contribution 

eg Degital Clock i have created if anyone want digital clock then you can take from npm;

what is package.json file
whatever the data is using in project add data in one file 
data of data. whatever project related dependencies will be there.
