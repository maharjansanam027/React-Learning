Day 2

when ReactRoot will render some element or anything then inside root whatever will be there it will
cleared and render what it has told to do it.


like this code rediability is gone we can't understand. 

so if we write code in index.html file like in js then it will easy to understand

<h1>
    like this.
</h1>

it will possible not by react. it has additional features jsx which will convert that html type file to react how we are writing write now.

<!-- we cant push this code on production because there is script file react and reactDOM  which has 5k lines of code 
    many code will there our production will slow there is space comments those fucntions which are not in use. so that makes the websiter run slow.
 -->
 so for this problem 

 we have bundler
